# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are applied to all build types.
#
# ProGuard is a tool that shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates your code by
# removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with
# semantically obscure names.
#
# You can find more details about how to use ProGuard at
